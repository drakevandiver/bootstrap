                <td>This is the day I was accepted to Madison Academic High School, where I still am today. It is the place I've met most of my friends, made career decisions, and the place which has changed my life the most.</td>
                <td>This is the year we went to Saint Thomas, USVI, on vacation. This vacation was the one which made me want to pick up sailing in the first place. It has been a hobby of mine ever since I visited the island, and I hope to return there one day soon.</td>
                <td>This is the day I finally got a job. Cracker Barrel decided to hire me despite the fact they were not taking new people on at the time. My work experience here has forever changed my life, and I would not change it for anything else. I am good at my job, which is not something I would expect. Through the connections I have made working there, I hope to be able to move up some time soon. </td>
